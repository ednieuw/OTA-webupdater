# OTA-webupdater
Uploads .bin files in the ESP32 by using wifimanager

### OTA HTML updater
With this Over The Air (OTA) updater is it possible to load binary .bin files generated by the Arduino IDE into the microcontroller.
   
The app is used to load .bin files into an Arduino ESP32 Nano. 

If the Nano is used for the first time the router credentials are not stored in the Arduino by the web manager.
Then a WIFI station will be started with the name: 

> Edsoft ESP32-OTA

Option 1: 
- Choose UPLOAD and upload the bin file.
- The new software will start. 

Option 2: 
- Select the blue button "Configure WIFI".
- Choose the router from the list and enter the password. (The IP adres is printed in the serial monitor)
- Restart the ESP32 and it will connect to WIFI.
